# Contribution Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute, the easiest being just using the library and creating issues
for problems that pop up or features that might be missing.

## Contributing Code

If you want to contribute code directly you can follow these easy steps:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your own feature in a branch based on the `main` branch
3. Create a Pull Request that targets the `main` branch

Make sure you include tests for your changes where appropriate.

If you need some media files to test your code you are encouraged use the files provided by the 
generated `com.github.kokorin.jaffree.Artifacts` class.

permission from the original creators to publish it in this manner.
